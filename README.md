# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the selling price of cars based on features such as mileage, age, and other relevant attributes using machine learning techniques.

## 📂 Files Included

- **Car_Prices.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete machine learning pipeline — data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **carprices.csv**: Dataset file containing information about various cars (e.g., mileage, age, price, etc.).

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Read the `carprices.csv` dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure of the data — column types, missing values, statistical summary.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Encode categorical variables (if applicable).
   - Feature scaling (if needed).
4. **Model Building**:
   - Use Linear Regression to build a prediction model.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate using metrics like R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
6. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions on new or test data.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python and the following packages installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```
## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `Car_Prices.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

## 📈 Example Output

After training the model, you will see outputs like:

- Coefficients and intercept of the regression model
- R² Score indicating model accuracy
- A plot comparing predicted vs actual car prices
